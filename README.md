# Crafting Interpreters (TypeScript)

This is a small hobby project where I’m implementing the interpreter described in  
**Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom**, using **TypeScript** instead of Java.

The goal of this project is educational: to better understand language design,
parsing, and interpreter implementation, while exploring how these concepts map
into the TypeScript ecosystem.

## About

### Work in progress

This is not intended to be a production-ready language or a strict 1:1 port of
the original implementation. Some design decisions may differ to better fit
TypeScript or for experimentation.

## Disclaimer

This project is for learning and experimentation only.
