# Crafting Interpreters (TypeScript)

This is a small hobby project where I am implementing the interpreter described in  
**Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom**, using **TypeScript**.

The goal of this project is educational, to better understand language design,
parsing, and interpreter implementation, while exploring how these concepts map
into the TypeScript ecosystem.
